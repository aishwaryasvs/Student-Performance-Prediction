# Student-Performance-Prediction
The "student-performance-prediction" repo is a machine learning project that predicts a student's percentage score based on the number of study hours. This repo contains a simple linear regression model that has been trained on a dataset of study hours and corresponding percentage scores to predict the percentage score for a given number of study hours. The code is written in Python and includes data visualization, data preprocessing, and model training and evaluation. The goal of this project is to help students and educators better understand the relationship between study hours and academic performance and to provide a tool for predicting student performance based on study habits.
